Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Used to be your arms around me  
Your body on my body  
  
When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Is there someone there to reach me?  
Someone there to find me?  
  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
And that's just torture to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Pull yourself into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Got to pull you close into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
Pull yourself right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Wish that you were here beside me  
Wish that your arms were around me  
Your body on my body

I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
To take me anywhere in seconds  
To take me anywhere I want to go  
And drive around a faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
At the touch of a button  
I can go anywhere I want to go  
And drive around my faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I think I want to change my attitude  
I think I want to change my oxygen  
I think I want to change my air  
My atmosphere  
I want to choke  
  
I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
To take me anywhere in seconds  
To take me anywhere I want to go  
And drive around my faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I think I need to change my attitude  
I think I want to change my oxygen  
I think I want to change my air  
My atmosphere  
I want to choke  
  
Bigger better  
Bigger and better  
Bigger and better  
Bigger stronger drive a faster car  
At the touch of a button  
I can go anywhere I want to go

To my surprise, and my delight  
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight  
I am nothing in the dark  
And the clouds burst to show daylight  
  
Ooh and the sun will shine  
Yeah on this heart of mine  
Ooh and I realize  
Who cannot live without  
Ooh come apart without  
It...  
  
On a hilltop, on a sky-rise  
Like a firstborn child  
And at full tilt, and in full flight  
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight  
  
Ooh and the sun will shine  
Yeah on this heart of mine  
Ooh and I realized  
Who cannot live without  
Ooh and come apart without  
Daylight  
  
Slowly breaking through daylight  
Slowly breaking through daylight  
Slowly breaking through daylight  
Slowly breaking through daylight

Oh, they say people come  
They say people go  
This particular diamond was extra special  
  
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know  
Still I see you celestial  
  
Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled  
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple  
  
So how come things move on?  
How come cars don't slow?  
When it feels like the end of my world  
When I should but I can't let you go  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
When I'm cold, cold  
There's a light that you give me  
When I'm in shadow  
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow  
  
Like the brothers in blood, sisters who ride  
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died  
But the changing of winds and the way waters flow  
Life as short as the falling snow  
Now I'm going to miss you, I know  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
In water rolled, salt  
I know that you're with me, and the way you will show  
And you're with me wherever I go  
And you give me this feeling, this everglow  
  
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold  
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow  
  
So if you love someone you should let them know  
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
<ENDSONG>
I turn the music up, I got my records on  
I shut the world outside until the lights come on  
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone  
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song  
  
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night  
Until Monday morning feels another life  
I turn the music up  
I'm on a roll this time  
And heaven is in sight  
  
I turn the music up, I got my records on  
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song  
Don't want to see another generation drop  
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop  
  
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees  
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes  
But my heart is beating and my pulses start  
Cathedrals in my heart  
  
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into  
To tell me it's alright  
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony  
And every tear's a waterfall  
Is a waterfall  
Oh  
Is a waterfall  
Oh oh oh  
Is a is a waterfall  
Every tear  
Is a waterfall  
Oh oh oh  
  
So you can hurt, hurt me bad  
But still I'll raise the flag  
  
Oh  
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall  
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall
<ENDSONG>
When I'm counting up my demons  
Saw there was one for every day  
With the good ones on my shoulder  
I drove the other ones away  
  
If you ever feel neglected  
If you think all is lost  
I'll be counting up my demons yeah  
Hoping everything's not lost  
  
When you thought that it was over  
You could feel it all around  
Everybody's out to get you  
Don't you let it drag you down  
  
Cause if you ever feel neglected  
If you think that all is lost  
I'll be counting up my demons yeah  
Hoping everything's not lost  
  
If you ever feel neglected  
If you think all is lost  
I'll be counting up my demons yeah  
Hoping everything's not lost  
  
Singing out  
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah  
Everything's not lost  
  
Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah  
Everything's not lost  
  
Oh oh oh yeah oh oh yeah oh oh yeah  
And everything's not lost  
  
Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah  
Come on yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah  
Everything's not lost  
  
Sing out yeah oh oh yeah come on yeah  
Everything's not lost  
  
Come on yeah oh oh yeah sing out yeah  
Everything's not lost
<ENDSONG>
When you try your best but you don't succeed  
When you get what you want but not what you need  
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep  
Stuck in reverse  
  
When the tears come streaming down your face  
When you lose something you can't replace  
When you love someone but it goes to waste  
Could it be worse?  
  
Lights will guide you home  
And ignite your bones  
And I will try to fix you  
  
High up above or down below  
When you're too in love to let it go  
If you never try you'll never know  
Just what you're worth  
  
Lights will guide you home  
And ignite your bones  
And I will try to fix you  
  
Tears come streaming down your face  
When you lose something you cannot replace  
Tears come streaming down your face  
And I  
  
Tears come streaming down your face  
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes  
Tears come streaming down your face  
And I  
  
Lights will guide you home  
And ignite your bones  
And I will try to fix you
