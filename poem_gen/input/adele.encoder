Where should I start  
Disjointed heart  
I've got no commitment  
To my own flesh and blood  
Left all alone  
Far from my home  
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I  
Keep it locked up inside  
Cannot express  
To the point I've regressed  
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I  
Keep it locked up inside  
Keep my distance from your lies  
It's too late to love me now  
You helped me to show me  
It's too late to love me now  
You don't take a word in  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Keep it locked up inside  
Keep my distance from your lies  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Keep my distance  
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness  
Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midriff  
Dark all I do embark the shadows  
Involved with my thought catalog, analogue, rap catalog  
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence  
The twisted web of tangled lies  
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste  
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes  
Against the state of being  
Feeling the weight-less-ness pressed between the ceiling  
Reeling around room  
Riding a bubble of sound proof  
It's the frequency making you  
Sha-Shake with every boom  
Involuntary muscle contraction  
Ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria  
The sound pounds to make the dead flush  
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff
I cannot take this anymore  
I'm saying everything I've said before  
All these words they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear the less you'll say  
You'll find that out anyway  
Just like before...  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I find the answers aren't so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
Just like before...  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break!  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge,  
And I'm about to break!  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break!  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge,  
And I'm about to break!  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
I'm about to break  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break!  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge,  
And I'm about to break!
Memories consume  
Like opening the wounds  
I'm picking me apart again  
You all assume  
I'm safe here in my room  
Unless I try to start again  
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose  
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  
I don't know what's worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
I don't know why I instigate  
And say what I don't mean  
I don't know how I got this way  
I know it's not alright  
So I'm breaking the habit  
I'm breaking the habit tonight  
Clutching my cure  
I tightly lock the door  
I try to catch my breath again  
I hurt much more than any time before  
I have no options left again  
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose  
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  
I don't know what's worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
I don't know why I instigate  
And say what I don't mean  
I don't know how I got this way  
I'll never be alright  
So I'm breaking the habit  
I'm breaking the habit tonight  
I'll paint it on the walls  
'Cause I'm the one at fault  
I'll never fight again  
And this is how it ends  
I don't know what's worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean  
I don't know how I got this way  
I'll never be alright  
So I'm breaking the habit  
I'm breaking the habit  
I'm breaking the habit tonight
The cycle repeated  
As explosions broke in the sky  
All that I needed  
Was the one thing I couldn't find  
And you were there at the turn  
Waiting to let me know  
We're building it up  
To break it back down  
We're building it up  
To burn it down  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground  
The colors conflicted  
As the flames, climbed into the clouds  
I wanted to fix this  
But couldn't stop from tearing it down  
And you were there at the turn  
Caught in the burning glow  
And I was there at the turn  
Waiting to let you know  
We're building it up  
To break it back down  
We're building it up  
To burn it down  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground  
You told me yes  
You held me high  
And I believed when you told that lie  
I played soldier, you played king  
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring  
You lost that right, to hold that crown  
I built you up, but you let me down  
So when you fall, I'll take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
And you were there at the turn  
Waiting to let me know  
We're building it up  
To break it back down  
We're building it up  
To burn it down  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground  
When you fall, I'll take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground  
When you fall, I'll take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
We can't wait  
To burn it to the ground
What do I do to ignore them behind me?  
Do I follow my instincts blindly?  
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams  
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?  
Do I sit here and try to stand it?  
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?  
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,  
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?  
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin  
I make the right moves but I'm lost within  
I put on my daily facade but then  
I just end up getting hurt again  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself  
I can't hold on.  
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin.  
It's all too much to take in.  
I can't hold on.  
To end things watching everything spin.  
With thoughts of failure sinking in.  
If I turn my back I'm defenseless  
And to go blindly seems senseless  
If I hide my pride and let it all go on  
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone  
If I let them go I'll be outdone  
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun  
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer  
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I ask why, but in my mind  
I find I can't rely on myself  
How do you think  
I've lost so much  
I'm so afraid  
I'm out of touch  
How do you expect  
I will know what to do  
When all I know  
Is what you tell me to  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
Don't you  
I can't tell you how to make it  
No matter what I do  
How hard I  
I can't seem to convince myself  
I'm stuck on the outside  
I can't hold on  
It's all too much to take in  
I can't hold on  
Without some failure sinking
Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe  
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me  
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know  
Somehow I need you to go  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Don't stay  
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well  
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself  
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know  
Somehow I need to be alone  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Don't stay  
I don't need you anymore, don't want to be ignored  
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away  
I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored  
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Don't stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Don't stay  
Don't stay  
Don't stay
I am not a pattern that we follow  
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal not a role model  
Not a born leader I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame  
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain  
And found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
Because even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
Because once you get a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be like the first  
And I'm not a robot. I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
Stop talking and start trying to catch up motherfucker  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker  
Pac said money changes situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step I ain't the one  
Chuck said an uzi weighs a motherfucking tone  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
I'm awfully underrated but pay me to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for record  
I am the opposite of where I got this  
A weak opposite, a slack sending them  
A heat sending them  
A crack closest to a peak  
Far from a punk  
Ya'll better start trying to catch up motherfucker  
And all the people say  
Try and catch up motherfucker  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
But when they come for me  
Come for me, I'll be gone  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker
Turn my mic up louder,  
I got to say something.  
Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,  
The syllables get pumping.  
People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,  
We march to the drumming.  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping.  
Fuck that, I want to  
See some fist pumping.  
Risk something.  
Take back what's yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
'Cause I'm sick of being treated  
Like I had before.  
Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the "next one could be me".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.
When you look into my eyes there's nothing else to see  
Nothing but your own mistake stearing back at you  
I was best student in a class  
Now all giving me ass  
I just cannot hide sense of guilty  
But I will follow my illness  
To the possible lines  
I'll choose right decision  
And show to world that I am not guilty by association  
Go away you  
Go away you  
Go away you  
Just like a heroin I'm falling apart  
Breaking my heart my angel left me!  
I'm too week to face me  
I never know why she only run so far away, far away from me  
I never know why she always runs so far away, far away  
Far away you  
Far away you  
Far away you  
Now you see Heroin is the reason, reason, reason...  
I can't tell you how to make it go  
Now matter how I do how hard I try  
I shouted the outside!  
Fear, scary  
Fear, scary  
Fear, scary

There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me  
Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy  
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away  
Afraid to say what was on my mind  
Afraid to say what I need to say  
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around  
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down  
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I wait till the upper hand is mine  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies  
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside  
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long  
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on  
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line  
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time  
Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand  
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
Now it's all gone.  
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say  
You realize you divide us but you lied anyway  
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all  
But what goes up has got to fall  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute you're on top  
The next you're not, missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think you've won  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
And then it's all gone  
Now it's all gone.
You try to find a reason why it all went away  
And you think of what you could have done different  
When you thought you were complete  
You opened up your eyes  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
You are around chasing things that disappear  
You can't get enough cauze you want it all  
When you thought you were okay  
You opened up your eyes  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall
I would have sailed away  
If I'd known that nothing would change  
Staring out my window sill  
In my wasted prison cell  
And I know what you want  
And I know what you fear  
As I cradle your loving  
And watch you disappear  
And I feel your heartbeat  
Pounding in my head  
I like to control you  
Cause I can't control myself  
Myself  
Rain,  
Come my way  
Mold my head  
Like a ball of clay  
Softly wither into my grave  
Never to see, the sun again  
All alone in a crowd by myself  
So sorry, wish I could find a way  
Back into your hole again  
But I've become your enemy  
Hole  
Maybe's a chance I've already keep y'all waitin'  
This goes out to everybody still hatin'  
For those that fake y'all can keep on fakin'  
Pokin' a plate for you to sink your whole face in  
Taste good only 'cause it's just so you know it's nothin'  
I getchu buggin' like tabooie and some robutussin  
It's just the way that I notions time I slap the track  
And turn around and choke each rhyme, pyrochlast  
To the nation like NPC, with pairs of 60's like an MPC  
To letter an ass woopin' via mp3,  
Givin' you people more reality than MTV  
Do a PPV snap necks with the pressure mega mess  
To carry you out on a stretcher  
You consume the ewl the law won't protect ya  
Even the courtroom sketcha can out sketch ya  
And now followin' me, got your number on column  
A D try you can holla with me, approach the pain  
I'ma check the body in threes, you can sittin' there stuttering  
Pr-probably, follow me,  
[Hook]  
I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
Here's news for you f-cka that cannot be done  
You can look and eye it pissed I have not begun  
Alcoholic, police close to bat,  
You think you're hard muh'f-cka'? you're an easter egg  
You gotta past at shell with a soft inside  
Squash your pride you think I f-ckin' lost my mind?  
I'm not playin'. I might as well be makin' a bomb  
I'm layin' down a foundation when I'm takin' you on  
Bet the fall of the rhyme for the sake of my mom  
She's like "Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on"  
It's funny but don't laugh, money with no cash  
The real of the vocab, killin' is no path  
The realest to romat, don't even know half  
I'm rankin' a full tank you're runnin' on low gas  
[Hook]  
Take that, crack off your fund,  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim and none  
You can take it I have finished I have not begun  
Gotta razor blade tongue  
And I kid this done  
No wonder just dumpin' on your crew for fun  
Machine stop got it locked like the game's a joke  
Say summin' funny get the whole gang to vote  
Let 'em pucka now f-cka go get your own  
We've been roamed ten years since we did this note  
The people on the block start to get numb  
They expect it it's fresh when the new sh-t come  
It grows, let 'em know they can fix around  
Railroad, rap hot tracks one and you're down  
And they're askin' repeat how I do this now  
Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound  
We just doin' what we do gettin' from that place  
We come in the back like we're on this b-tch  
Turn the lights down low when we start this show  
What, you two get me right back in the go  
[Hook]  
It's take that, take that, cuttin' if your fun  
You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim to none  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun  
Follow me I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
But I got news for you f-cka that cannot be done  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun
Ain't nothing working, ain't nothing right  
There's a whole in me, that I can't fill, no matter how hard I try  
Hey, hey, hey bartender, hit me with a double  
And introduce me to that girl with the bobble  
I'm looking for trouble tonight  
No momma don't trust me tonight  
You be the center baby, I'll be the quarter back  
High get the tail back, watchin all the play back

I want you to comfort me, just come with me  
Hey bartender, hit me with another  
I'm just about how to kill this brother  
I'm lookin for trouble tonight

There ain't nothing sweeter, there ain't nothing wrong  
All the pain that I've received keeps me strong,  
It keeps me moving on  
I just want your company,  
I want you to comfort me,  
Just come with
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down  
Stars are slipping down, glistening  
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now  
No deceiving now, it's time you let me know  
Let me know  
When the lights go out and we open our eyes,  
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
Let the sun fade out and another one rise  
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
This in between us is getting thinner now  
Into winter now, bitter sweet  
Across that horizon this sun is setting down  
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go  
And tell them I couldn't help myself  
And tell them I was alone  
Oh, tell me I am the only one  
And there's nothing left to stop me  
Let me apologize to begin with  
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say  
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed  
And somehow I got caught up in between  
Let me apologize to begin with  
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say  
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed  
And somehow I got caught up in between  
Between my pride and my promise  
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way  
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
Let me apologize to begin with  
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say  
But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed  
And somehow I got caught up in between  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
And I cannot explain to you  
In anything I say, or do, or plan  
Fear is not afraid of you  
Guilt's a language you can understand  
I cannot explain to you in anything I say or do  
I hope the actions speak the words they can  
For my pride and my promise  
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way  
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come  
The only thing that's worse than one is...  
For my pride and my promise  
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way  
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
The only thing that's worse than one is none
Separate, sifting through the wreckage  
I can't concentrate, searching for a message  
In the fear and pain, broken down and waiting  
For the chance to feel alive  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
Come apart, falling in the cracks  
Of every broken heart, digging through the wreckage  
Of your disregard, sinking down and waiting  
For the chance, to feel alive  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one
Telling me to go  
But hands beg me to stay  
Your lips say that you love  
Your eyes say that you hate  
There's truth in your lies  
Doubt in your faith  
What you build you lay to waste  
There's truth in your lies  
Doubt in your faith  
All I've got's what you didn't take  
So I, I won't be the one  
Be the one to leave this  
In pieces  
And you, you will be alone  
Alone with all your secrets  
And regrets  
Don't lie  
You promise me the sky  
Then toss me like a stone  
You wrap me in your arms  
And chill me to the bone  
There's truth in your lies  
Doubt in your faith  
All I've got's what you didn't take  
It starts with one thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away  
It's so unreal  
Didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know  
Wasted it all just to watch you go  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me  
Will eventually be a memory of a time when  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
One thing, I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how  
I tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
You kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I've put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
I've put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter
Time, why must it fly so slow  
Waiting, is something that's easy for you  
Pull the plug, send it down the drain  
Pain is easy to get used to  
What's in me, is in you  
What's got me, has got you  
And everything told, must come true  
Pretending to be real, forgetting who you are  
Sin, is always at my door  
Slice the vein, blood spilled on the floor  
Light shining in my eyes  
Death greets me with a smile  
Pain  
So much pain  
Pain  
So much pain
When you were standing in the wake of devastation  
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown  
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now  
You were there impossibly alone.  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.  
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel  
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars  
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space  
No one there to catch you in their arms  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go,  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failure's all you've known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go, let it go.
I knew I was being threatened  
Do you think it's worth holding out?  
I mean I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys  
Ugly stories  
Watch them flee  
Watch them flee  
Rap up  
Watch them flee  
Hip-Hop hits  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound  
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now  
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down  
The melting pot of a super-future X-style  
The combination of a vocal caress  
With lungs that gasp for breath  
From emotional stress  
With special effects  
And a distorted collage  
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage  
It's going down  
The logical progression on a the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on an audible odyssey  
Now it's going down  
A logical progression on the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on a an audible odyssey  
Now it's going down  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Put put it up  
It said it go- go- goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Once again it is  
Composed sentences all together venomous  
The four elements of natural force  
Projected daily through the sound of the source  
Everybody on board with this blend  
The sword with the pen  
The mightiest is the weapons  
Swinging right from the chin  
The elevate of mental states  
Long gone with the wind  
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends  
It's going down  
Stalence emulation readily  
Trekking through the weaponry  
Of the pure pedigree  
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me  
Whatever the weather be  
We invent the steadily  
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high  
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots  
Execution of collaborative plots  
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop  
It's going down  
A logical progression on a the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on an audible odyssey  
Now, it's going down  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
X-men 'bout to blast of world wide  
Yo it's request only  
X- men 'bout to blast of world wide  
It's built from scratch  
Album in stores soon  
'Bout to blast off world wide  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
It's going down  
Like this...
I break down, fear is sinking in  
The cold comes, racing through my skin  
Searching for a way to get to you  
Through the storm you  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
With arms up, stretched into the sky  
With eyes like, echoes in the night  
Hiding from the hell that you've been through  
Silent one, you  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
You go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You go, giving up your home  
Go, you are not alone  
You are not alone  
You are not alone  
You are not alone
I cannot take this anymore  
Saying everything I said before  
All these words, they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear, the less you say  
You'll find that out anyway  
Just like before...  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
I find the answers aren't so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts, they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
Just like before...  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to... break!  
[Hook]  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
Shut up when I'm talking to you!  
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  
I'm about to break!  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to... break!
Part of me won't go away  
Everyday reminded how much I hate it  
Weighted against the consequences  
Can't live without it, so it's senseless  
Wanna cut it out of my soul  
And just live with a gaping hole  
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste  
I made the problems in the first place  
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me  
You hardly see it right next to the heart of me  
Heard of me, the routine scar  
New cuts cover where the old ones are  
And now I'm sick of this  
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity  
I rather not even be then the man  
That's staring in the mirror through me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it  
Once it's been dealt with you feel like  
You've been touched by something angelic  
And then melted down into a pool of peace  
Cease to be the animal you used to be  
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong  
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone  
And then you start to see another piece  
Of yourself that you can't let be  
Memories of the last fight to free yourself  
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well  
And now you know that you can choose  
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise  
You can live if you're willing to  
Put a stop to just what's killing you  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
Alive in me, inside of me  
A part of me screams away silently  
This part of me won't go away  
Part of me won't go away  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be  
Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I feel it swell up inside  
Swell up inside, swallowing me  
I look around...  
I look around...  
I look around and I see myself  
I look around and I see myself  
I'm piercing the skin  
I'm piercing the skin  
One more time, I'm piercing the skin  
Its going deeper through the skin  
Going down, going down  
Go.. In.. Down!  
I turn around and I look at myself  
I see the blood on the floor  
I see the cut on my arm  
I ask myself why  
I'm piercing the skin  
One more time, I'm piercing the skin  
Its going deeper through the skin  
Going down, going down  
Go.. In.. Down!  
Its hard to find you when your not around  
I know that your here smiling down  
You look at me and I look at you  
But nothing you can say or do  
Compares to the pain that I felt  
When you said we would go our seperate ways
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay  
'Till they came to take what I had left away  
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today  
But I remember you saying that yesterday  
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control  
Every memory and confession born out of your soul  
Like a pill you couldn't swallow so it swallowed you whole  
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of your plight  
Fire so out of control  
Every memory and confession born out of your soul  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of you lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped up inside your  
Lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You're lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies  
I don't know what I thought I might say  
Seems like we never would talk the right way  
Every other minute I fought for my place  
And drop what I made thought you might say so  
I'm guessing that you probably know  
When your inside's hollow and you want to be cold  
Like a pill hard to swallow so it swallowed you whole  
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of your lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped inside your lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You're lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies  
You're faking, you're mistaken  
If you think that you could climb out of this hole  
Forsaken, what would take me?  
Analyzing by the power of your soul  
Broken down, a victim of your  
Faking, your mistaken  
If you think that you could climb out of this hole  
Broken down, a victim of your lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Wrapped up inside your lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You don't know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped up inside your  
Lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You're lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies
Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for paths left lone  
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end  
It's the worst kind of pain I've known  
Give up your heart left broken  
And let that mistake pass on  
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost  
And in time you'll be glad it's gone  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  
whoa, whoa  
Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for sights unseen  
May your love never end and if you need a friend,  
There's a seat here alongside me  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  
Whoa, whoa
You say you're not gonna fight  
'Cause no one will fight for you  
And you think there's not enough love  
And no one to give it to  
And you're sure you've hurt for so long  
You've got nothing left to lose  
So you say you're not gonna fight  
'Cause no one will fight for you  
You say the weight of the world  
Has kept you from letting go  
And you think compassion's a flaw  
And you'll never let it show  
And you're sure you've hurt in a way  
That no one will ever know  
But someday the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
Hold on, the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
So hold on, the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
So hold on, the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
Just hold, on the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare  
See how I'll leave with every piece of you  
Don't underestimate the things that I will do  
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch  
And it's bringing me out the dark  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it to the beat  
Baby, I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you  
And I'm gonna make your head burn  
See me in the depths of your despair  
Making a home down there  
Cause mine sure won't be shared  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it to the beat  
We could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it with a beating  
Throw your soul through every open door  
Count your blessings to find what you look for  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow  
You're gonna wish you never had met me  
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep  
You're gonna wish you  
You could have had it all  
You could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside of your hand  
But you played it  
You played it  
You played it  
You played it to the beat
Sometimes things just seem to fall apart  
When you least expect them to  
Sometimes you want to pack up and leave behind  
All of them and all their smiles  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
Sometimes people surprise you  
And people surprise me  
But I guess that's the price we pay  
For wanting so badly  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
Sometimes...Sometimes...Sometimes
I will be waiting  
With a song in my soul  
A fortunate weakling  
Which I have foretold  
He raises his arms tied  
Above the abyss  
Singing his sweet song  
His melody opens up the sun  
Freedom raid  
God has come  
Rivers of blood  
Pushed back in my veins  
She sleeps with her eyes closed  
To dream of the past  
Her mind has gone blind now  
While the memory closes up this sun  
Freedom rain  
God has come  
Rivers of blood  
Pushed back in my veins  
[yeah]  
I will be waiting  
With a song in my soul  
A fortunate weakling  
Which I have foretold
Note: Like "Morei Sky" and a couple of other submitted songs, this is a Grey
Daze song, Chester Bennington's band before Linkin Park..  
I want to pick up the pieces, so that  
There's less complication, so that  
There's less conversation, and  
Less aggravation  
I want to go out alone, man, so that  
There's less confrontation, and man,  
There's less association, and  
Less company, yeah  
I was so frustrated, man, that  
I was all confused, man, and that  
I was disillusioned, and  
sick of your friends  
Run, don't walk my way  
Don't look my way  
Cause I don't care, oh, no  
So why are you still here  
Why don't you disappear  
And spin out of my life, oh  
Why do we have limitation, and man  
Why do we have limitation, so that  
We don't get very far, and so that  
We don't climb very high  
I can't handle the indecision, and  
I can't watch no more television, and  
I won't miss you when you're gone  
Cause I know my life will go on  
I know the answers from the words of  
The prophet  
I've seen the light through the fingers  
Made of magic  
I've seen an image of the future,  
It's a vision and I know who you are  
Go away can't you see you're not real  
Open your eye some place far away  
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky  
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly  
I met a poet tonight behind the masses  
I sang a song about my many true  
Addictions  
I saw myself in a hole, down below  
And I know who you are  
I'm alright though it's hard to feel  
Open your eye some place far away  
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky  
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Open your eyes  
Look to the sky  
Grab your wings  
And then, start to fly  
2x  
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky  
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly  
2x
Watch as the room rocks men only moon walk  
Mixed media slang, banging in your boom box  
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist  
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish  
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty  
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an Emcee  
With your lack of skill and facility you're killing me  
And a DJ in the group just for credibility  
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes  
You're not an Emcee if someone else writes your lines  
And rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer  
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years  
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up  
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck  
So how does it stack up? None of it's real  
You want to be an emcee you've got to study the skill  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up  
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity  
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy  
With a tendency to make up stories  
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40  
And your record company is completely missing it  
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate  
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit  
And get smacked with verbal back flips  
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts  
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this  
You're new to hip hop and welcome if your serious  
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced  
Using the waves of sound the true master  
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up, step up  
After years of pain staking research  
By the world's leading sound scientists  
We here at the sound institute have invented  
A reliable audio weapons system  
Actual movement of musical sound  
In space used to carefully attack and neutralize  
The cellular structure of the human body  
And the question must be asked  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Bring it to you every time like this?  
Who can rock a rhyme like this?  
Step, step up, step, step up, step up  
Mixed media step up to the microphone  
And you do it like this
You fell away  
What more can I say  
The feelings evolved  
I won't let it out  
I can't replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
So many words  
Can't describe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I can't relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
Hook  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine
God bless us everyone

And when I close my eyes tonight  
To symphonies of blinding light  
We're a broken people living under loaded gun, oh)  
Like memories in cold decay  
Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky  
God save us everyone,  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?  
For the sins of our hand  
The sins of our tongue  
The sins of our father  
The sins of our young  
No  
God save us everyone,  
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?  
For the sins of our hand

Transmissions echoing away  
Far from the world of you and I  
Where oceans bleed into the sky

People turn around, people let you down  
Anywhere you go, anywhen you see  
It's real  
It's up to you to make it happen  
It's up to you to make it real  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
Tell me what you know  
Tell me how you feel  
It doesn't matter when you're down  
When you look at me with your eyes  
That smile on your face it seems happy  
Are you happy?  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
Yeah Yeah  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some  
And you know how it feels  
To beat some  
To need some
Water gray  
Through the windows, up the stairs  
Chilling rain  
Like an ocean everywhere  
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?  
I mean nothin' to you  
The little things give you away  
And now there will be no mistakin'  
The levees are breakin'  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
Hope decays  
Generations disappear  
Washed away  
As a nation simply stares  
Don't wanna reach for me do you  
I mean nothin' to you  
The little things give you away  
But there will be no mistakin'  
The levees are breakin'  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
All you've ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under ground now  
Now I...  
Now I do  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
When you feel you're alone  
Cut off from this cruel world  
Your instincts telling you to run  
Listen to your heart  
Those angel voices  
They'll see you to you  
They'll be your guide  
Back home where life leaves us blind  
Love keeps us kind  
It keeps us kind !  
When you suffered it all  
And your spirit is breaking  
You're growing desperate from the fight  
Remember your love  
And you always will be  
This melody will always bring  
You right back home  
When life leaves us blind  
Love, keeps us kind!  
When life leaves us blind  
Love keeps us kind!  
Oh oh!  
Oh oh!  
Oh oh!

03 pm. Pshyicans have listed the cause of death as respitory failuare and
Cardiopulmanary Arrest. Mr. Shakur's Body has been removed from the hospital

Linkin Park Lead Singer: Yo  
September 13, 1996 Tupac in the mist of some Suge Knight bullshit  
Nobody saw it coming nobody knew what hit  
Its been almost seven years since you been gone we all miss you dawg that's  
Why I wrote this song from me against the world to all eyes on me you was  
A real muthafucka yah you made me see uh uh yah you made me see  
I said nobody saw it coming, nobody even knows why, somebody please tell  
Me why you had to die  
Yo  
March 9, 1997 L. A. California another 1-8-7 you were ready to die just like
your album said so many playa haters that want to see you dead you took the  
Game of brooklyn and gave it to the whole world your whole life revolved  
Around rap and you lil' girl I can't believe these rappers try to bite yo  
Style even Em and 50 in 8 mile Biggie Small you was the man you was the  
Myth you was the legend I wonder if you and pac made peace in heaven  
This song is dedicated to Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls  
Yo yo  
It goes a one, two, three  
With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun  
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come  
Original style, like an eight of eight drum  
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run  
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets  
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got  
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it  
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it  
Like that  
It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right  
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite  
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right  
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights  
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose  
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes  
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you  
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view  
Like that  
Give me the strength of the rising sun  
Give me the truth of the words unsung  
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing  
Bring me to kingdom come  
This is something for your people on the block to  
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need  
Like Papa, who shot ya  
Seperate the weak from the obsolete  
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors  
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all  
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying  
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up  
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?  
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing  
With the big guns only get you slain  
I ain't playing, I'm just saying  
You ain't got a sliver of a chance  
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents  
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down  
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down  
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you  
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?  
It's like that  
We swim against the rising waves  
That crash against the shore  
The body bends until it breaks  
The early morning sings no more  
So rest your head  
It's time to sleep  
And dream of what's in store  
The body bends until it breaks  
And sings again no more  
'Cause time has torn the flesh away  
The early morning sings no more
My insides all turned to ash, so slow  
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold  
A black wind took them away from sight  
And now the darkness over day, that night  
And the clouds above move closer  
Looking so dissatisfied  
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing  
I used to be my own protection, but not now  
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow  
A black wind took you away from sight  
And now the darkness over day, that night  
And the clouds above move closer  
Looking so dissatisfied  
And the ground below grew colder  
As they put you down inside  
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing  
So now you're gone, and I was wrong  
I never knew what it was like to be alone  
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day  
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day  
No regret for the confidence betrayed  
No more hiding in shadow  
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid  
Time has come for you  
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized  
Victimized, victimized, never again victimized  
They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them  
As the sound comes higher on this violent rhythm  
These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom  
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em  
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden  
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em  
Go on already hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kiddin'  
Wanna talk about a victim, I'ma put you there with 'em!  
This is not the end  
This is not the beginning,  
Just a voice like a riot  
Rocking every revision  
But you listen to the tone  
And the violent rhythm  
And though the words sound steady  
Something empty's within 'em  
We say Yeah!  
With fists flying up in the air  
Like we're holding onto something  
That's invisible there,  
'Cause we're living at the mercy of  
The pain and the fear  
Until we get it, forget it,  
Let it all disappear.  
Waiting for the end to come  
Wishing I had strength to stand  
This is not what I had planned  
It's out of my control  
Flying at the speed of light  
Thoughts we're spinning in my head  
So many things were left unsaid  
It's hard to let you go  
I know how it feels to lie,  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I haven't got  
Sitting in an empty room  
Trying to forget the past  
This was never meant to last,  
I wish it wasn't so  
I know how it feels to lie,  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I haven't got  
Yeah, yeah  
What was left when that fire was gone?  
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong  
All caught up in the eye of the storm  
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on  
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said  
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead  
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?  
The hardest part of ending is starting again!  
All I wanna do  
Is trade this life for something new  
Holding on to what I haven't got  
This is not the end  
This is not the beginning,  
Just a voice like a riot  
Rocking every revision  
But you listen to the tone  
And the violent rhythm  
Though the words sound steady  
Something empty's within 'em  
We say Yeah!  
With fists flying up in the air  
Like we're holding onto something  
That's invisible there,  
'Cause we're living at the mercy of  
The pain and the fear  
Until we get it, forget it,  
Let it all disappear  
Should I have a taste of this  
Start and crush your nails  
And start all over again  
Could this all just be a dream  
If I should fall to stormy weather  
Wake Me, Wake Me  
yeah  
Maybe this time I can do it all wrong  
Without my foot in my mouth  
Without that blind in my sight  
Could this all just be a dream  
If i should fall to stormy weather  
Wake Me, Wake Me  
yeah  
2x  
oh, oh  
Too scared to lose the one  
I tried so hard for  
Too scared to lose the one  
I never had  
2x  
One, two, one, two, three, four!  
There's no peace. Only war  
Victory decides who's wrong or right  
It will not cease. Only grow  
You better be prepared to fight!  
And it will not apologize  
For laying down your life  
War!  
There's no pain. It will spare  
Death has become your only right  
And once you're lost  
In your despair  
Forever black, eternal light  
And it will not apologize  
For laying down your life  
War!  
Destroyer!  
War!  
Destroyer!  
It needs no side to justify  
Laying down your life  
War!  
Destroyer!  
War!
This is war with no weapons, marching with no stepping  
Murder with no killing, I'll in every direction  
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal  
A John with no Yoko  
More power, less people  
And yeah I'm not afraid of that, print in your paperback  
Every rapper's made in fact, to act as a delayed attack  
Every phrase a razor blade, and save it till they play it back  
Slay em leave em laying on the paper bank, fade to black  
In the wastelands of today,  
When there's nothing left to lose  
And there's nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
Roll credits, forget it, the show's done,  
They're talking for just talkin,  
Meaning they got none,  
None of you come proper,  
They talk like a shotgun  
But how many of you got bred with integrity, not once  
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckas hold a blade to me,  
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be,  
Take it how you take it,  
I'm the opposite of vacancy,  
And this not negotiation,  
I can hear you, wait and see!  
In the wastelands of today,  
When there's nothing left to lose,  
And and there's nothing more to take,  
But you force yourself to choose,  
In the wastelands of today,  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away,  
And your world turns into fear,  
And your world turns into fear,  
In the wastelands of today!  
In the wastelands of today  
When there's nothing left to lose  
And and there's nothing more to take  
But you force yourself to choose  
In the wastelands of today  
When tomorrow disappears  
When the future slips away  
And your world turns into fear  
And your world turns into fear  
In the wastelands of today  
In the wastelands of today  
In the wastelands of today
In this farewell  
There's no blood, there's no alibi  
'Cause I've drawn regret  
From the truth of a thousand lies  
So let mercy come and wash away  
What I've done  
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done  
Put to rest what you thought of me  
While I clean this slate  
With the hands of uncertainty  
So let mercy come and wash away  
What I've done  
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done  
For what I've done  
I start again  
And whatever pain may come  
Today this ends  
I'm forgiving what I've done  
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done  
What I've done  
Forgiving what I've done  
If everything would just stop  
Then maybe I could clear up my thoughts  
If everything would stand still  
I could've hidden how lost I feel  
I should've said what I hear  
I should've let myself fear  
I should've made myself clear  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when we find we lost our minds  
We fake what we don't know  
I never asked to let go  
I never thought I could sink so low  
I never let myself down  
Until the second I did right now  
I should've said what I hear  
I should've let myself fear  
I should've made myself clear  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when we find we lost our minds  
We fake what we don't know  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when our heads betray our hearts  
We fake what we don't know  
Cause all we are is everything we've done  
All we are is how quickly we run  
And all we are  
We are  
This is how we fall apart  
But this is how beginnings start  
Cause when our heads betray our hearts  
We fake what we don't know  
And if our doubt begins again  
The answers find us in the end  
So in the meantime we'll pretend  
And fake what we don't know  
This is how we fall apart  
But this is how beginnings start  
Cause when our heads betray our hearts  
We fake what we don't know  
And if our doubt begins again  
The answers find us in the end  
So in the meantime we'll pretend  
And fake what we don't know
I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,  
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice.  
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war,  
This way of settling difference is, is not just.  
This business of burning human beings with napalm,  
Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows,  
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane.  
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields  
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged,  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
I know that its over I hate when its over,  
The more I think about you the more I want to call  
Now that you see me can you belive me,  
Why do you look so scared,  
I don't know if I can live without you  
I don't know if I am free without you  
The more I think of you the more it intenceifies my heart,  
Hideing in a sea of lies,  
Once I swore I die for you now I'm not so sure,  
I can't change you,  
Now we'are through  
I don't if can live without you  
I don't know if I am free without you  
There's a time, when the operation of the machine becomes so odious.  
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part,  
You can't even passively take part.  
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels,  
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus.  
And you've got to make it stop!  
To save face, how low can you go?  
Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know.  
Static on the wind, makes us all say whoa!  
The people up top push the people down low.  
Get down, and obey every word.  
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard.  
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd.  
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt.  
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know  
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload  
And no one make a move, unless my people say so  
Got everything outta control, now everybody go  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Feel alone, final blow  
We, the animals, take control  
Hear us now, clear and tall  
Wretches and kings, we come for you  
So keep face, how slow can you go?  
Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know.  
Fire on the wind, makes you all say whoa!  
The people up top and the people down low.  
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that.  
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at.  
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat  
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact  
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know  
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no.  
So push the button, let the whole thing blow.  
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Feel alone, final blow  
We, the animals, take control  
Hear us now, clear and tall  
Wretches and kings, we come for you  
Still alone, fight our blow  
Filthy animals beat down low  
Steel and bone, black and blue  
Run at the sunshine, we come for you  
From the front to the back and to side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high  
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious.  
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part,  
You can't even passively take part.  
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels,  
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop!  
And you've got to indicate to the people, run in to the people on it.  
And unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Shut up!

Shut up!  
Shut up!  
When I'm talkin' to you  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
I'm about to!  
Wasn't that fun?  
Lets try something else, else, else, else  
Point 45 caliber killer out of the filla  
Elevated show your brothas how your not a gorilla  
Smooth talking fully automatic weapon constiller  
Taste thrilla, great filler  
Hit him like a Godzilla  
Filthy stinking standing on the side of the ground  
Still be sinking submerging in the parks  
Still be linking plucked beats when it starts  
Hope your thinking it's not a mirage  
I'm in a mother fucking tractor without a disguise  
Well if you could duck but it's hard to dodge  
In the back of that spine where my darkness lies  
Flippin straight up ripping apart your side  
X-Ecutioner's style cuts and blends  
Like a syringe banging you in each of your limbs  
See me coming through your party hard  
Without no body guard  
Smoking something, stomping on each of your tims  
I'm a B to the L to A to C king  
And when it comes around I hear the key thing it's  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!  
Shut up!
I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I'm about to break  
This room to breathe  
This room to breathe  
This room to breathe  
I cannot take this anymore  
Saying everything I've said before  
All these words, they make no sense  
I found bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear, the less you say  
You'll find that out anyway  
I find the answers aren't so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts, they make no sense  
I found bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
Just like before  
Everything you say to me  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And I'm about to break  
These are the places where I can feel torn from my body  
My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like  
I'm about to break  
Waiting alone, I cannot resist  
Feeling this hate, I have never missed  
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face  
Blood is a pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
Shut up when I'm talking to you  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up when I'm talking to you  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring

Blood is pouring

Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And I'm about to  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  
And I'm about to
Nah, you don't know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me  
You cannot stop, much less control me  
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores  
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors  
Say it's all you can take, better take some more  
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate  
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight  
Stood up strong in spite of that hate  
Night gets darkest right before dawn  
What don't kill you makes you more strong  
And I been waiting for it so long  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
When I was young, they told me, they said  
Make your bed, you lie in that bed  
A king can only reign 'til instead  
There comes that day it's "off with his head"  
The night gets darkest right before dawn  
What don't kill you makes you more strong  
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
And I told them, nah, you don't know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me  
You cannot stop, much less control me  
When it rains, it pours  
When the floodgates open, brace your shores  
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors  
Say it's all you can take, better take some more  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes
Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun,  
We laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind,  
Like any other time,  
But little did we know...  
Today, I look for a sign, with flames in my hands,  
A line in the sand, between yours and mine,  
And it came, like fire from below,  
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall,  
But little did you know  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
You had sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood,  
We were counting on a leader,  
We were driven by need, couldn't take temptation,  
And we were blinded by greed,  
You were steady as a sniper,  
We were waiting on a wire,  
So we never saw it coming,  
When you ran from the fire,  
You can try intimidation,  
Or you can try to roar,  
But when the time comes calling,  
Yeah! You are gonna get yours!  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
And so today, your truth has come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
You're out of time,  
And you will give me back what's mine  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine, give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine! What's mine!  
Give me back what's mine!  
Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind, like any other time,  
But little did we know...
I watch how the  
Moon sits in the sky in the dark night  
Shining with the light from the sun  
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming  
The moon's going to owe it one  
It makes me think of how you act to me  
You do  
Favors and then rapidly  
You just  
Turn around and start asking me about  
Things you want back from me  
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and  
Step on people like you do and  
Run away the people I thought I knew  
I remember back then who you were  
You used to be calm used to be strong  
Used to be generous but you should've known  
That you'd  
Wear out your welcome now you see  
How quiet it is all alone  
I'm so  
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I'm so  
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you don't understand  
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
Shut up  
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place, to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest
In this desert  
In darkness  
Lying with the gun across his chest  
Pretending  
He's heartless  
As the fire flashes in the sky  
He was fragile  
And frozen  
When the bullet took away his friend  
And now he's somehow  
More broken  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
Sweating  
And shaking  
Lying with her hands across her chest  
She wakes with  
Her cravings  
As the fire flashes in her eye  
She was fragile  
And frozen  
When the needle took away her friend  
And now she's somehow  
More broken  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
With every battle he's chosing  
With every fight he's losing  
His enemy's not far behind  
With every promise she's broken  
With every lie she's spoken  
Her enemy's not far behind  
It's your time  
It's your time  
It's your time  
It's - your - time!  
He's pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
She's pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
With every battle he's chosing  
With every fight he's losing  
His enemy's not far behind  
With every promise she's broken  
With every lie she's spoken  
Her enemy's not far behind
Ok what is it tonight  
Please just tell me what the hell is wrong  
Do you wanna eat  
Do you wanna sleep  
Do you wanna shout  
Just settle down, settle down, settle down  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Just marry me, marry me, marry me  
I'm so sick of you tonight  
You never stay awake when I get home  
Is Something wrong with me  
Somethings wrong with you  
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew  
Well I'll give you candy  
Give you diamonds  
Give you pills  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
Because you married me, married me, married me  
When I was young I played a game  
That love and happiness were the same  
Now I'm older and I don't play  
And I found out the hardest way  
I got wasted  
She got mad  
She called me names then she got her dad  
He got crazy and I did too  
Wond'ring what I did to you  
Well I'll give you candy,  
Give you diamonds,  
Give you pills,  
I'll give you anything you want  
Hundred dollar bills  
And I'll even let you watch the shows you wanna see  
I'll do anything, anything, anything,  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything...
Don't start with the ugly part  
Don't end with the things that will make them want to walk away  
Tune in at the den again, Another price ain't cheap but somebody's gonna have
to pay  
Oh yes, you can only guess, what it is, what it was  
Or remember what I had in mind  
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block, half-cocked nearly half the
time  
Give it back, give it back, give it back, sing it  
One time for the words divine and  
Two times for the things that you hope you never have to say  
Three seams in a dead man's dream  
And the girls tell the boys that they better fucking run away  
Live it up, won't you give it up,  
Turn it up, put it out, let it ride with the other lie  
Shotgunning on a joy ride, coming down the block, half-cocked nearly all the
time  
Give it back, give it back, give it back, sing it
Atom bombs  
Something's wrong  
D. E. A sent to Guam  
Acid trips  
Big fat chicks  
Purple Flintstone vitamins  
All the needy, rich are greedy  
I find out  
You don't need me  
Berlin Wall starts to fall  
I trip out to the wall  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Ku Klux Klan makes a plan  
To destroy the black man  
Air pollution, no soloution  
What is causing this confusion  
Anarchism satanism  
Anti-Christ socialism  
A man's brain is deranged  
So we think he's insane  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
I don't wanna be the one to blame,  
You like fun and games,  
Keep playin' them,  
I'm just sayin',  
Think back then,  
We was like one and the same,  
On the right track,  
But I was on the wrong train,  
It's like that,  
Now you've gotta face the pain,  
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play,  
In your brain, like a maze, you could never escape the rain,  
Every damn day's the same shade of grey,  
I used to have a little bit of a plan,  
Used to, have a concept of where I stand,  
But that concept slipped right outta my hand,  
And now, I don't really even know who I am, yo,  
What do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
I guess,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
Back then, I thought you were just like me,  
Somebody who could see all the pain I see,  
But you proved to me, unintentionally,  
That you would self-destruct, eventually,  
Now I'm thinking like a mistake I made doesn't hurt, but,  
It's not gonna work,  
''cause it's really much worse than I thought,  
I wished you were something you were not,  
You turn your back and walk away in shame,  
All you got is a memory of pain,  
Nothing makes sense if you stare at the ground,  
So what do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
I guess,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
I guess,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
You're on your own now, believe me.
I'm stuck in this bed you made  
Alone with a sinking feeling  
I saw through the words you said  
To the secrets you've been keeping  
It's written upon your face  
All the lies how they cut so deeply  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and never say  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down black out blood in your eye  
You say that it's not your fault  
And swear that I am mistaken  
You said it's not what it seems  
No remorse for the trust you're breaking  
You run but then back you fall  
Suffocate in the mess you're making  
You can't get enough you take  
And take and take and take and take  
Fuck it are you listening?  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you've gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No, you'll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
Black out blood in your eye  
Floating down, as colors fill the light  
We look up from the ground  
In fields of paper white  
And floating up you pass us in the night  
A future gazing out a past to overwrite  
So come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect the things you know  
Come down far below  
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies  
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea  
And poured it out in an ocean of debris  
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
We held our breathe when the clouds began to form  
But you were lost in the beating of the storm  
But in the end we were made to be apart  
In separate chambers of the human heart  
Ooh, I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
It's in the blackened bones  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
I'm swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
The blame is mine alone  
For bridges I have burned  
So don't apologize  
I'm losing what I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve  
What I don't deserve, ooh woah  
What I don't deserve  
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
She can't hide no matter how hard she tries  
Her secret disguise behind her lies  
And at night she cries away her pride  
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside  
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night  
All her family asking if she's all right  
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell  
But all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself  
She can only fool herself  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
When it comes to how to live his life  
He can't be told  
Says he's got it all under control  
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with  
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit  
An addict and he can't hold the reigns  
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same  
Tries to slow down the problem he's got  
But can't get off the carousel  
Until he makes it stop  
He can only fool himself  
I'm too weak to face me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
I never know just why you run  
So far away, far away from me  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you  
Fly with me under the wings I gave you,  
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Take me down to the river bend  
Take me down to the fighting end  
Wash the poison from off my skin  
Show me how to be whole again  
Fly me up on a silver wing  
Past the black where the sirens sing  
Warm me up in a nova's glow  
And drop me down to the dream below  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
Bring me home in blinding dream  
Through the secrets that I have seen  
Wash the sorrow from off my skin  
And show me how to be whole again  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything else I need to be  
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
Consuming, confusing  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
Controlling  
I can't seem  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
That there's just too much pressure to take)  
I've felt this way before  
So insecure  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me  
Distracting, reacting  
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection  
It's haunting how I can't seem  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
That there's just too much pressure to take)  
I've felt this way before  
So insecure  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds, they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing, confusing what is real  
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
I have a dream of a scene between the green hills  
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed  
People don't talk about keeping it real  
It's understood that they actually will  
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees  
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze  
Watch them flee, hip-hop hits  
Take a walk with me and what you'll see  
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax  
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue  
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme  
And emcees have left materialism behind them  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might  
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night  
Because this is dedicated to the kids  
Dedicated to wherever music lives  
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same  
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game  
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong  
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong  
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run  
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun  
I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum  
Out on sunset strip, he asked me "How would you feel  
If everybody acted like you didn't exist  
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip. "  
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this  
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it  
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest  
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith  
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain  
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again  
Meanwhile I just grip my mic  
And hope me and my team make it through alright  
Because say what you will, and say what you might  
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night  
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside  
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide  
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside  
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide  
This is dedicated to the kids  
Dedicated to wherever music lives  
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same  
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game  
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe  
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place  
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run  
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun
Punture me  
Make me feel  
Like I am real  
Torture me  
Drag me under you  
Time  
Lifts me up and down  
Time  
Makes me  
Shout  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
Please treat me  
Like I am a fallen angel  
Surpress me  
Tell me  
Lies  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
You can't tell me  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Drag!  
Drag!  
Drag!
It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
Something has been taken from deep inside of me  
A secret I've kept locked away  
Wounds so deep they never show  
They never go away  
Like moving pictures in my head  
For years and years they've played  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
Sometimes I remember  
The darkness of my past  
Bringing back these memories  
I wish I didn't have  
Sometimes I think of letting go  
And never looking back  
And never moving forward so  
There'd never be a past  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could  
Stand up and take the blame I would  
If I could take all the shame to the grave  
Just washing it aside  
All of the helplessness inside  
Pretending I don't feel misplaced  
Is so much simpler than change  
It's easier to run  
Replacing this pain with something numb  
It's so much easier to go  
Than face all this pain here all alone  
It's easier to run  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made  
It's easier to go  
If I could change I would  
Take back the pain I would  
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would  
If I could stand up and take the blame I would  
I would take all the shame to the grave
Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...  
Then in the middle came Motion Man...  
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time  
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle  
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder  
I brought you back of the thing  
Like the imaginary man of your dreams  
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it  
A sleek skin I never nerved you  
You felt lovin, I never applied a room  
Without bringing the plan  
By any means and means of leaving you teens,  
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt  
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt  
One thing I don't know how  
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter..  
In the end
Riding with a head full of bodies are red  
And what I said is still stuck in my head  
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back  
But an all front attack, you could never run from that  
Being trapped in this with you,  
Somethin' that I never wanted to do  
But through it all you've got to see that where I want to be  
Is over the pen again letting it out of me  
In the center of the day in the dream, reading all my thoughts  
Getting lost in between, realizing one that the way to the sea  
And the killing and again with a head full of screams  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
And the second it starts we're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart  
Going in the hollow, hoping that you won't know  
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done  
And consequently I've run away, just hidden again  
Within the boundaries of the nameless  
Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down  
Lost in the chaos being tossed around  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away...  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away.!!!  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see it's not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
Shut... Up... Now!!!  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day you'll regret this  
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time  
Adding to the panic of my confine
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard  
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact  
That everyone can see these scars  
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel  
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you  
To just believe this is real  
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
Face away and pretend I'm not  
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got  
I can't feel the way I did before  
Don't turn your back on me  
I won't be ignored  
Time won't heal this damage anymore  
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored  
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident  
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can  
But sometimes I don't make sense  
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt  
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me
out  
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
You face away and pretend I'm not  
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got  
You hear me out now  
You're gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now, hear me out now  
You're gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now  
Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them  
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'  
It's like nothing I can do would distract me when  
I think of how I shot myself in the back again  
'cause from the infinite words I can say I  
Put all pain you gave to me on display  
But didn't realize instead of setting it free I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
Hearing your name the memories come back again  
I remember when it started happening  
I see you n' every thought I had and then  
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them  
And I knew as they escaped away  
I was committing myself to em n' everyday  
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see that I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
Everything comes down the memories of  
I kept it in without letting you  
I let you go so get away from  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
Everything comes down the memories of  
I kept it in without letting you  
I let you go  
Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say  
Suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away  
'Cause I don't have a reason  
And you don't have the time  
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever but then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
All I've ever wanted, the secrets that you keep  
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak  
'Cause I can't see forgiveness,  
And you can't see the crime  
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over, the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over,  
The scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
From the top to the bottom  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
There's a place so dark you can't see the end  
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend  
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions, forcefully  
The power of suggestion, then with the eyes shut  
Looking through the rust and rot and dust  
A small spot of light floods the floor  
And pours over the rusted world of pretend  
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs  
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound the wheels go round  
And the sunset creeps behind street lamps  
Chain link and concrete  
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn  
Floats on down the street till the wind is gone  
And the memory now is like the picture was then  
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop  
At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts  
Taken far from my safety, the picture's there  
The memory won't escape me, but why should I care?  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back  
I'm telling you that, I see it right through you  
In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up  
In the memory, you will find me, eyes burning up  
The darkness holding me tightly, until the sun rises up
I don't know who to trust your surprise  
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
Tension is building inside steadily  
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
I won't waste myself on you  
You  
You  
Waste myself on you  
You  
You  
I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
Everything from the inside and just throw it all away  
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you  
You  
You
[Spoken]  
Of course you know what a fuse is...  
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder  
When you strike a match and light it  
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end  
At which there is, a little surprise  
Krypton, short suit mcs you'll be ripped on  
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you just slipped on  
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong  
Rock on, sing songs mightier than King Kong  
A Donkey, you think you want me or want this  
Want some, hold your reputation for Ransom  
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics  
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic  
Galactic, space now yeah that grabs attention  
Crack heads nodded like a pest can't even mention  
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections  
Kid steps this he need witness protection  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
It was the junkyard crooked letter C-I-entific  
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum  
Hear one, lalala loose frind me fearsome  
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone  
Testing the eight-hundred, eighteenth battalion  
Shallow the one who's run like rebels  
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level  
In intensity, send back the tax that you sent to me  
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me  
Mp3 versus R33 mcs, Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze  
We're mcs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking 'bout you
want these  
Please, don't even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it
down like pens  
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the
back of an mcs hand  
With the strength that he had a bridge you don't want that close body fields
in hand to hand combat  
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords  
Come deford shots get rid don't question my intention when your butt gets
kicked  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Why wait, I didn't look down myself  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
I'll be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks
Wake in a sweat again  
Another day's been laid to waste  
In my disgrace  
Stuck in my head again  
Feels like I'll never leave this place  
There's no escape  
I'm my own worst enemy  
I've given up  
I'm sick of feeling  
Is there nothing you can say?  
Take this all away  
I'm suffocating!  
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!  
I don't know what to take  
Thought I was focused, but I'm scared  
I'm not prepared  
I hyperventilate  
Looking for help somehow, somewhere  
And no one cares  
I'm my own worst enemy  
God!  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my misery  
Put me out of my...  
Put me out of my fucking misery!  
Will you, walk me to the edge again?  
Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again  
Woke up tonight and no one's here with me  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Caught up, in life  
Losing all my friends  
Family has tried, to heal all my addictions  
Tragic it seems, to be alone again  
I'm giving in... To you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Watch me crumble  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
I look forward, to dying tonight  
Drink till I'm myself, life's harder every day  
The stress has got me  
I'm giving in  
Giving in  
Giving in now!  
Take me under  
I'm dying tonight  
Watch me crumble  
I'm crying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you  
Take me under  
I'm giving in to you  
I'm dying tonight  
I'm giving in to you
Tell us all again what you think we should be,  
What the answers are, what it is we can't see.  
Tell us all again how to do what you say,  
How to fall in line, how there's no other way.  
But oh, we all know  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same.  
Show us all again that our hands are unclean,  
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need.  
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved,  
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way.  
And oh, you will know  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
same).  
You're guilty all the same!  
[Rakim]  
Yeah, you already know what it is.  
Can y'all explain, what kind of man is destined?  
When a man has plans of being rich,  
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?  
Dirty money scheme, a clean split,  
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy.  
Talk team, they take the paper route,  
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty.  
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience.  
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me.  
Smoke scream, we're going in flames,  
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be,  
Say it's time for things to change.  
We arrange that dope product we built cheap,  
Anything if it's more to gain.  
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep,  
Until no more remains, but I'm still me  
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio  
You record companies kill me  
Try to force me to strain it, no way  
They got the gall to say "yo, how real can real be?"  
You feel me? You will see, the greed will be to blame  
Greedy for the fame, tv or a name  
Media, the game, to me your all the same  
You're guilty.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame.  
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed,  
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame,  
same).  
Guilty all the same.
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....  
Hybrid  
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space  
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits  
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with
telekanetic psychology  
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it  
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist  
Many men have tried to shake us  
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of  
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you
MC's who hate us  
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on  
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones  
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this  
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise  
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice  
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones  
Never satisfied my rhymes jones  
Spraying bright day over what you might say  
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A  
On highways write with road rage  
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around  
Surround sound  
Devouring the scenes  
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things  
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit  
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics  
Forth dimension, compact convention  
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention  
Ment to put you away, with the pencil  
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile  
While you risk your all  
I pick out at your flaws  
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

Who's the man, the man in your hand over your land  
Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova  
I am vics clorousos, the most ferocious  
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage  
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest  
Then I might blast the masses  
Subliminals transmitted through piano  
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano  
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through
time  
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles  
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules  
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram  
I bot your head, fat your lip like collagen

I scream through the morning  
I'm kicking in the twilight as she comes  
Time waits at a darling  
Spooning the thickness out and feeding our open mouths  
The price you pay is always  
Too high, I'm too familiar  
Sunshine, Karma Killer  
Time waits at the darling  
I spread through the morning  
Feeding our open mouths and spooning the thickness out  
The price you pay is always  
My eyes are weary now  
My eyes are weary  
My eyes are weary now  
Karma Killer  
Will I ever miss you?
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
Its our Final war  
Tell me what's worth fighting for  
When we know there's nothing more  
Take the hand or fist  
Just to sell ourselves for this  
The path we least resist  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
Uh, I give you what you came for  
This is not the same though  
Got a different method  
But I still can bring the pace so  
Not all give the same though  
I got down the same flow  
I ain't shock and get you  
Never really in my range, though  
Somehow they ain't grow. High five, bango  
All pride childs. Mama let the bass bang though  
All you fucking lames go  
Yelling out the names though  
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
I'm my own casualty
I dreamed I was missing  
You were so scared  
But no one would listen  
Cause no one else cared  
After my dreaming  
I woke with this fear  
What am I leaving  
When I'm done here?  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
When my time comes  
Forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed  
And don't resent me  
And when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory  
Leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest  
Don't be afraid  
I've taken my beating  
I've shed but I'm me  
I'm strong on the surface  
Not all the way through  
I've never been perfect  
But neither have you  
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are  
I can't be who you are
And the tears fall like rain  
Down on my face again  
Oh the words you wouldn't say  
And the games you played  
With my unfoolish heart  
Oh I should have known this from the start  
Oh the winter and spring  
Going hand in hand  
Just like my love and pain  
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vain  
Oh this brand new skin stretched across scared terrain  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
Oh...  
All those years down the drain  
Love was not enough when you want everything  
What I gave to you and now the end must start  
Oh I should have listened to my heart  
'Cause I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
Oh...  
I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my life again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road  
So I don't wanna be let down  
I don't wanna live my lies again  
Don't wanna be lead down the same old road
I'ma be that nail in your coffin  
Sayin' that I soften  
I was duckin' down to reload  
So you can save your petty explanations  
I don't have the patience  
Before you even say it I know  
You let your pride and your ego  
Talk slick to me no  
That is not the way I get down  
And look at how you lose your composure  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
What is it you want me to tell ya?  
I'm not the failure  
I would rather live and let be  
But you can't make the right kinda threat to  
Push me to let you  
No, you can't intimidate me  
You disrespect me so clearly  
Now you better hear me  
That is not the way it goes down  
You did it to yourself and it's over  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery
You were that foundation  
Never gonna be another one, no  
I followed, so taken  
So conditioned I could never let go  
Then sorrow, then sickness  
Then the shock when you flip it on me  
So hollow, so vicious  
So afraid I couldn't let myself see  
That I could never be held  
Back up, no, I'll hold myself  
Check the rep, yep you know my rail  
Forget the rest let them know my hell  
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell,  
Kept respect up the vets stay their,  
Let the rest be to tell they tale  
That I was there saying  
And these promises broken  
Deep, feeble  
Each word gets lost in the echo  
So one last lie I can see through  
This time I finally let you  
Go, go, go  
Test my will, test my heart  
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up  
Y'all go hard, I go smart  
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?  
I've seen that frustration  
Big cross, they're lost but don't know  
And I've come back unshaken  
Let down, I've lived and let go  
So you can let it be known  
I don't hold back, I hold my own  
I can't be mad, I can't be calm  
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone  
I can't fall back, I came too far  
Hold myself up and love my scars  
Let the bells ring wherever they are  
'Cause I was there saying  
No, you can tell 'em all now  
I don't back up, I don't back down  
I don't fold up, and I don't bow  
I don't roll over, don't know how  
I don't care where the enemies are  
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!  
Won't forget how I got this far  
And every time, saying  
When I pretend  
Everything is what I want it to be  
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see  
When I pretend  
I can forget about the criminal I am  
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can, but  
I can't pretend this is the way it will stay, I'm just  
Trying to bend the truth  
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be  
So I'm  
Lying my way from you  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
I remember what they taught to me  
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be  
Remember listening to all of that and this again  
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in  
And now you think this person really is me and I'm  
But the more I push  
The more I'm pulling away  
'cause I'm  
Lying my way from you  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
This isn't what I wanted to be  
I never thought that what I said  
Would have you running from me  
Like this  
You  
I want to be pushed aside  
So let me go  
Let me take back my life  
I'd rather be all alone  
Anywhere on my own  
Cause I can see  
The very worst part of you  
The very worst part of you  
Is me
There's a fragile game you play  
If the ghosts of yesterday  
If we can't let go whenever, say goodbye  
No trace of what remains  
No stones to mark the graves  
Only memories we thought we could deny  
There's so much more to lose  
Than the pain I put you through  
And my carelessness that left you in the dark  
And the blood may wash away  
But the skies will never fade  
At least I know somehow I made a mark  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right  
In the dark,  
In the light  
Nothing left,  
Nothing right
I've lived through things I cannot say  
Back then we dreamt of yesterday  
It seemed as if the only way  
And now we look for hope and pray  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing in the end  
If I had a second chance  
I'd make amends  
Only to find myself  
Losing, losing  
It came up from the deepest sea  
God gave it life and reason to be  
His Shadow rose above the highest tree  
And still his face we could not see  
This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
This is my December  
This is my snow covered home  
This is my December  
This is me alone  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said to you  
And I'd give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
This is my December  
These are my snow covered trees  
This is me pretending  
This is all I need  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didn't feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things I said to you  
And I give it all away  
Just to have  
Somewhere to go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to
So this is the last treat of the night coming up right here  
This is a song, this is a tour actually, this is the first time we've played
this song on tour  
I'll spit it out eventually  
Anybody like the Deftones?  
Got any Deftones' fans in the house?  
Put em' up if you are  
Let me see you if you know the words to this shit and i'll come down and sing
it with you  
Hey you, big star, guide me when it's over  
Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter  
'Cause I'm through, when the two hits the six and it's summer  
Cloud, come  
Shove  
The sun  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer  
You guys feeling that?  
Who can help me with this shit, can you?  
Can you help me with this shit?  
Stay right here, stay right here  
Hey you..  
Stay right here  
Come on  
Yo, yo  
What the fuck is going on?  
Yea, bring him over here  
Allright bro, we gonna teach these mother fuckers this shit, ok?  
You guys gonna help us out right now?  
Allright you guys  
Chester, when you're ready bud  
The shade is a tool, a device, a savior  
See, I try  
And look up  
To the sky  
But my eyes burn  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it  
The sun  
Aside  
Cloud, come  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Shove  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
The sun  
Shove it, shove it, shove it  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
There's no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer
You might as well quit while your at it  
You aint going no where  
I feel so hollow inside  
And it' s all your fault  
You' re the cause of all this pain  
Now I' m left here dying  
You think you can beat me  
It' s never gonna happen  
You wanna reach the end  
It' s never gonna happen  
Do what you wanna do  
It aint gonna happen  
I wont let you do this  
Not anymore  
Ur so vindictive  
You always have been  
I regret the day I met you, I saw you  
Now you don' t even remember me  
I' m just the voice in your head  
Screaming, crying  
And telling you......  
That it aint gonna happen ....
I remembered black skies  
The lightning all around me  
I remembered each flash  
As time began to blur  
Like a startling sign  
That fate had finally found me  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross  
The distance in your eyes  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
There was nothing in sight  
But memories left abandoned  
There was nowhere to hide  
The ashes fell like snow  
And the ground caved in  
Between where we were standing  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
Across this new divide  
In every loss  
In every lie  
In every truth that you'd deny  
And each regret  
And each goodbye  
Was a mistake to great to hide  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
Across this new divide  
Across this new divide
Are you lost  
In your lies?  
Do you tell yourself "I don't realize"?  
Your crusade's a disguise  
Replace freedom with fear  
You trade money for lives  
I'm aware of what you've done  
No, no more sorrow  
I've paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced  
I see pain  
I see need  
I see liars and thieves  
Abused power with greed  
I had hope  
I believed  
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived  
You will pay for what you've done  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
Thieves and hypocrites!  
No more sorrow  
I've paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced!  
Your time has come to be replaced!  
Your time has come to be erased!
Standing alone with no direction  
How did I fall so far behind'  
Why am I searching for perfection  
Knowing it's something I won't find'  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
'Til the silence splits me open, I run  
'Til it puts me underground  
'Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
When did I lose my sense of purpose'  
Can I regain what's lost inside'  
Why do I feel like I deserve this'  
Why does my pain look like my pride'  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I let myself down  
In my fear and flaws, I run  
'Til the silence splits me open, I run  
'Til it puts me underground  
'Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
No roads left but one  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
And the silence splits me open, I run  
And it puts me underground  
But there's no regret  
And no roads left to run
Come, come, come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Come, coming at you,  
Peep the style and the kids checking for it  
The number one question is  
How could you ignore it  
We drop right back in the cut  
Over basement tracks  
We're just rolling with the rhythm  
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division  
With these non-stop lyrics of life living  
Not to be forgotten  
But still unforgiven  
But in the meantime there are those who want to  
Talk this and that, so I suppose  
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt  
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt  
Try to give you warning  
But everyone ignores me  
But nobody's listening  
Call to you so clearly  
But you don't want to hear me  
But nobody's listening  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
And everything's left is a waste of time  
I hate my rhymes  
I'm riding on the back of this pressure  
Guessing that it's better  
I can't keep myself together  
Because all of this stress  
Gave me something to write on  
The pain gave me something  
I could set my sights on  
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears  
The uphill struggle over the years  
The fear and trash talking  
And the people it was to  
And the people that started it  
Just like you  
I got a  
Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears  
Nothing to gain, everything to fear  
Coming at you at every style
I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface  
I don't know what you're expecting of me  
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
Become so tired, so much more aware  
By becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
Can't you see that you're smothering me?  
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control  
'Cause everything that you thought I would be  
Has fallen apart right in front of you  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
And every second I waste is more than I can take!  
And I know I may end up failing too  
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there  
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
We stood upon the edge  
Eyes fixed in the sky  
Just before twilight  
Claimed the lights  
Wind carried voices  
Over the waters  
From a whisper  
Into a scream  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
The words that we cast  
Into eternity  
They still echo in my ears  
And in my dreams  
So meet me tonight  
In the place that time forgot  
And take with you  
All that you can't leave behind  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
Headlights open  
The road ahead  
They can't light up the sky  
But they can light our way  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here
Hurry up and wait  
So close, but so far away  
Everything that you've always dreamed of  
Close enough for you to taste  
But you just can't touch  
[Bridge]  
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated  
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
One step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
You believe and you doubt  
You're confused, you got it all figured out  
Everything that you always wished for  
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours  
If they only knew  
[Bridge]  
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated  
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
One step at a time  
There's no need to rush  
It's like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
It's gonna happen when it's  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
When you can't wait any longer  
But there's no end in sight  
When you need to find the strength  
It's the faith that makes you stronger  
The only way we get there  
Is one step at a time  
Take one step at a time

I want to be in another place,  
I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night,  
Shining with the light from the sun,  
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,  
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,  
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,  
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,  
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,  
Find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed,  
While I find a place to rest.  
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to  
Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya  
Gimme energon to keep me calm  
You and your mom keep on the drom  
Used to be a team, passed that baton  
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb  
Take it to the john in your babylon  
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on.  
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn  
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on.  
So sick of you stressin'  
Sick of you fessin'  
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.  
Sick of you stressin'  
Sick of you fessin'  
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.  
I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,  
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.  
You try to get the best of me, go away, go away, go away,  
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine  
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind  
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through  
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end  
I'm left with emptiness that words can not defend  
You'll never know what I became because of you  
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side, powerless  
Powerless  
Powerless
Why's does it feel like night today?  
Something in here's not right today  
Why am I so uptight today?  
Paranoia's all I got left  
I don't know what stressed me first  
Or how the pressure was fed  
But I know just what it feels like  
To have a voice in the back of my head  
It's like a face that I hold inside  
A face that awakes when I close my eyes  
A face that watches everytime I lie  
A face that laughs everytime I fall  
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim  
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
Hey yo  
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind  
But I find myself in places with names but no faces  
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees  
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
The face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun  
Can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through  
You take away if I give in  
My life, my pride, is broken  
You like to think you're never wrong  
You have to act like you're someone  
You want someone to hurt like you  
You want to share what you've been through  
Learned, learned, learned, learned, learned  
You love the things, I say I'll do  
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you  
You take away, when I give in

Oh, oh
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken,  
The lost and the sights unseen.  
I want a flood, I want an ocean,  
To wash my confusion clean.  
I can't resolve this empty story,  
I can't repair the damage done.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
We act it out, we wear the colors,  
Confined by the things we own.  
We're not without, we're like each other,  
Pretending we're here alone.  
And far away, they burn their buildings  
Right in the face of the damage done.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
[Bridge]  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
We lost before the start!  
Rebellion, rebellion,  
One by one we fall apart!  
We fall apart! We fall apart! We fall apart!  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of, Imitations of...  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Who've never faced oppression's gun.  
We are the fortunate ones,  
Imitations of rebellion!  
Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion.

Hey, Mike, what's up?  
This is Roc, just asking you what's happening?  
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went  
Um, just seeing if you're going to see Joe sometime soon, too,  
Because he's got my keyboard that I've been trying to get back  
I've been trying to call him and he hasn't been returning any messages  
So I'm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back  
Heyy dude this is a good idea to get a message around...i like that  
Graffiti decorations  
Under the sky of dust  
A constant wave of tension  
On top of broken trust  
The lessons that you taught me  
I learned were never true  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
Paper bags and angry voices  
Under a sky of dust  
Another wave of tension  
Has more than filled me up  
All my talk of taking action  
These words were never true  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye  
Gonna run away

Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why

No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind

With the promises we made  
Skin to bone, steel to rust.

When your name is finally drawn,  
I'll be happy that you're gone  
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.  
Right to left, left to right  
Night to day and day to night  
As the starlight fades to gray,

With the promises betrayed  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust

There's no way to find out what's inside you  
Until you fall into the hole  
You dug for yourself while you slept here  
Too young, too selfish, too cold  
And when you find out what's been waiting  
The moment you open your eyes  
You'll see your true reflection  
The very first time in your life  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run  
Into the hole you fall deeper  
Deeper the faster you run  
It won't stop until you've accepted  
Accept everythng that you've done  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
You can not fight what's in you  
It's going to be denied  
Cry to yourself  
Nothing will help  
It's too late to change what's been done  
You do what you've always done best  
You run
Caught up against the wall again  
Tied and chained to the ball again  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Cut and bruised by the fall again  
Lick my wounds like a dog again  
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel  
That I see I see please let it be but don't  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end  
To the pain I feel when I'm  
Awake and alive alive alive  
Alive and not dreamin'  
Caught up against the wall again  
Tied and chained to the ball again  
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel  
That I see I see please let it be but don't  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Wake me till the morning after  
Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end  
To the pain I feel when I'm  
Awake and alive alive alive

We knew the world would not be the same.  
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.  
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita.  
Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty  
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,  
Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.  
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.
See I was once told  
That I would litterate gold  
Now I'm at the crossroads  
Selling my soul  
I've been laughed at  
Slepped on and stepped on  
Backstabbed twice but I always kept on  
I'm falling  
And I can hear my conscience calling  
I see my life dissolving  
While I'm one stallin  
Why life's gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay  
Just to live another day  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
She saw life's a bitch but I love her  
Brother never judge a book by the cover  
Same name but different faces  
Same case but different places  
Life's strange  
Joy, pain  
Sunshine, rain  
Yo we've gotta maintain  
Why life gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay just to see another day  
Get yourself up, you're falling   
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
It spill blood, sweat and tears  
I crept on my knees  
And begged for deaf ears  
I wouldn't learn  
Until I got burned  
Every laugh was changed  
That was the day it got turned  
Lifes Strange somebody wants me to obtain  
Some people change, others stay the same  
Why life's gotta be this way  
See it's the price we pay just to live another day  
Get yourself up you're falling  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up get up, don't stop, you're falling  
Get yourself up you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
You're living on a lie
I am not a pattern to be followed  
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow  
I'm not a criminal, not a role model  
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame or the same person telling you to forfeit the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbelly's
sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
'cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first  
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beat's funky  
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk  
Ya'll oughta stop talking  
Start trying to catch up motherfucker!  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
Lauryn said money change the situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one  
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a motherfuckin' ton  
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it  
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma say it for the record  
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak  
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack  
Closest to a peak, far from a punk  
Ya'll oughta stop talking, start trying to catch up mother fucker  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
When they come for me  
Come for me  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker!
You've been taking it all this time  
You left my trust on the firing line  
As the promises break, the only mistake -  
Giving you what was mine  
Your words are clear but their meanings gone  
The notes are right but the tunings wrong  
And when you tell me again that I should give in  
I can only take it so long long long long  
Fear is dancing inside your lies  
Exposing secrets that you've disguised  
And I'm biting my tongue as you become  
Victim of a compromise  
Cause I know who you really are  
Not a scratch where you can take a scar  
And it's time that you seek the truth without me  
I can only get you so far far far far  
This is the first day of my last days  
I built it up, now I take it apart  
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far  
No need to me to stay, the last thing left I just threw it away  
I put my faith in god and my trust in you  
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do  
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I'm the one without a soul, I'm the one with this big fucking hole  
Now new tale to tell, twenty-six years on my way to hell  
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck  
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me, I hate everyone  
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I want to, but I can't turn back  
But I want to.
I woke up in a dream today  
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor  
Forgot all about yesterday  
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore  
A little taste of hypocrisy  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're so close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
It's true  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
Even when I close my eyes  
I hit you and you hit me back  
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still  
Fine line between this and that  
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real  
Now I'm trapped in this memory  
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react  
Even though you're close to me  
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back  
The way I feel  
Was promised by your face  
The sound of your voice  
Painted on my memories  
Even if you're not with me  
Even when I close my eyes  
No, no matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
No matter how far we've come  
I can't wait to see tomorrow  
Keeping everything inside
